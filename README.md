# lithic-boilerplate
Robust boilerplate for development and deployment.

This boilerplate is in a early development state, and while it does the job, it probably shouldn't be used in a production environment at this time... 

More documentation coming soon; for now, refer to `package.json` scripts and `gulpfile.js` comments for information on build and run tasks.
